\chapter{Equipment}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The following is a list of all the equipment that
characters might buy or otherwise acquire through
their adventures.

Note: because freeholds are isolated and have little
in the way of resources, it's unlikely that any given
freehold will have everything in these lists.

In particular, things that require a lot of artisanal
skill to create—like full plate—are going to be
extremely rare.

\section{Costs and Currency}

After the breaking of the world, there was no central
authority to control the value of coinage. As such, no
one currency is considered to be the standard.

Much coinage still exists in the world, but it's judged
by its weight and not its appearance.

For simplicity's sake, all costs in this chapter are
given in gold coins (gc), silver coins (sc), copper
coins (cc), or pieces of eight (pe).

A gold coin is worth ten silver coins.

A silver coin is worth ten copper coins.

So, a gold coin is worth a hundred copper coins.

Also, copper coins are often cut into pieces for smaller
transactions. A single coin will be cut into eight pieces,
and so "pieces of eight" are used for things that cost
less than a copper coin.

Most people do not have a steady income. However, the
average village craftsman will likely earn roughly
8 gc over the course of a year in a freehold.

\section{Shields}

Shields increase the user's Armor Class by 1 if worn.
Note: tower shields are not meant to be worn, but rather
to be used as mobile walls.

\textbf{Note:} You can use bows as a blunt weapon, but they will break
the first time you do this. After that, they are useless until
repaired.

\section{Tools}

These tools are readily available in most freeholds.

\section{Livestock}

While adventuring or traveling for long periods of time,
it may be helpful to have a ready meat source available.

\section{Horses}

Horses are valuable. A single quarterhorse is likely the most
expensive thing a typical farmer owns. In the world after the
Breaking, horses that are formally trained for battle are
almost unheard of.

\section{Housing}

Building a house requires land ownership or rent, if you're
building it near a freehold. If you're building in the wilderness,
good luck to you.

Renting a room for a night at an inn varies, but is commonly
less than a copper coin.
