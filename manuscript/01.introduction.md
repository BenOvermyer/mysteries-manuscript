# Introduction

An apocalypse destroyed the world as it used to be.  No one knows what caused it or recalls what the old world was like. Most refer to the apocalypse as the Breaking of the World, or 'The Breaking' for short.

In the aftermath of the Breaking, most of the world has been overtaken with untamed wilderness. Scattered throughout the wilderness are the ruins of the old world, and occasionally a large town known as a freehold.

There is some trade between freeholds, but the distance and danger between them makes sharing supplies and knowledge difficult. Ruins are filled with artifacts and knowledge that could help your freehold survive and thrive. The wilds and the ruins also have an abundance of horrific, magic-twisted monsters.

You know little of the world outside of your freehold, but perhaps itâ€™s time to start to learn more. It is up to you to help rebuild your community. Do you have the courage, skill, and luck to bring back treasures from the dark places? Will you save your Freehold from the encroaching wilds?

These are your stories now. Go forth, and uncover the Mysteries of a Broken World!
