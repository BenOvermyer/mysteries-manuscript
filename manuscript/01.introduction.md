# Introduction

Mysteries of a Broken World is a game where you play the role of an adventurer helping your
community rebuild three generations after an apocalypse destroyed the world as it used to be.

This apocalypse is called the Breaking of the World, or just the Breaking for short. No one
knows what caused it or what the old world was like. As a character in the aftermath of this
event, you know little of the world outside of your Freehold. There is some trade between
Freeholds, but most of the world is now untamed wilderness.

Scattered throughout the wilderness are the ruins of the old world. These ruins are filled
with artifacts and knowledge that could help your Freehold survive and thrive. The wilds and
the ruins also have an abundance of horrific, magic-twisted monsters.

Do you have the courage, competence, and luck to bring back treasures from the dark places?
Will you save your Freehold from the encroaching wilds? These are your stories now. Go forth,
and uncover the Mysteries of a Broken World!
