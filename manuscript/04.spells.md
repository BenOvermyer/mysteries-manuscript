# Spells

This chapter lists all of the spells available to characters.

## Demonic, Level One

### Corrupt Ferocity

*Range:* Infinite

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 3

You create an effigy of a specific living thing. The effigy must
be made with some part of the thing in question, whether a hair
or blood or other piece. As soon as you submerge the effigy in
a concoction of wine and blood, the victim becomes angrier
and more aggressive, even towards friends.

### Withering Touch

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You touch a living thing and drain its life essence, causing 1d8
damage and making the target visibly weaker and shrivelled. In
humanoids, this can take the form of an almost skeletal appearance,
with sunken eyes and skin stretched thinly over the bones. The
appearance effect lasts until the victim gets a good night's sleep.

## Divine, Level One

### Consecrate Ground

*Range:* Special

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 3

By tracing the intended area of effect with your footsteps while
chanting a prayer to your patron deity, you consecrate the area
in their name. For the duration of the spell, any creatures opposed
to the will of your patron deity find it difficult to enter the
affected area. Entering the area causes them physical pain,
though it does no damage. You may trace an area of any size or
shape, as long as you are able to complete the tracing of the area
within a single recitation of your prayer. The area extends up to
ten feet above and below the area traced.

### Ease Pain

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You lay a hand on a creature or person and they immediately feel
better, both physically and mentally. They regain 1d4+1 lost Hit
Points and any suffering they are undergoing is reduced in
severity.

## Elemental, Level One

### Dampen

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

The object or living thing that you touch becomes covered in a fine
mist of water. It's not enough to douse a flame, but it may deter
a flame from starting.

### Kindle Flame

*Range:* 5'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

A nonliving, flammable object within range suddenly lights on fire.
The initial flame is no bigger than the palm of a hand, but it can
spread quickly.

## Enchantment, Level One

### Levity

*Range:* 30'

*Duration:* 5 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

A creature in range is suddenly possessed of great joy and happiness.
It is far less likely to be hostile, and far more likely to be
friendly. The effect is cancelled if the creature is attacked or
otherwise harmed.

### Lighten

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

For the duration of the spell, the object or living thing that you touch
weighs half as much as it normally does.

## Gate Magic, Level One

### Blink Object

*Range:* 10'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

A nonliving object smaller than a door is instantly teleported
up to five feet away from its original position. It must teleport
to an empty space, and it doesn't necessarily teleport exactly
to the point specified.

### Second Step

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

For the duration of the spell, the creature that you touch walks
or runs twice as fast as normal. This does not affect combat
actions. The affected creature is hungry immediately after the
spell ends.

## Nature, Level One

### Let It Grow

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You touch a patch of dirt. Shortly afterward, a plant of your choice
sprouts from the dirt, fully grown. The plant must be a nonsentient
variety.

### Vines

*Range:* 10'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

Creeper vines burst from the ground and rapidly grow up the side of
a wall or building in range. The vines cover an area 10' x 10' in
size. After that, they cease their rapid growth and are, for all
intents and purposes, just normal vines.

## Necromancy, Level One

### Haunted Visage

*Range:* Self

*Duration:* 30 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You utter a few gutteral words, and your appearance changes. You
appear as if recently risen from the dead, with gaunt features and
pale skin. The odor of freshly turned earth accompanies you.

### Speak to Spirits

*Range:* Earshot

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You send part of your consciousness into the spirit world.
While in this state, you can speak to any spirits within the immediate
vicinity. Taking damage in the material world will end the spell.

## Thought Magic, Level One

### Project Consciousness

*Range:* 100'

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You abandon your body, causing it to fall lifeless for the duration of
the spell. Your consciousness appears roughly in the area you specify,
though you have the same senses you would as if you were physically in
the area. Your consciousness is undetectable to normal senses. You
may end the spell early at will and return to your body. You are aware
of any harm that happens to your body, and if you are killed while in
this state, your consciousness immediately becomes an enraged ghost.

### Store Memory

*Range:* Self

*Duration:* 5 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You store the memory of everything that happens in your immediate
vicinity for the duration of the spell inside a crystal you are holding
as the spell ends. Afterwards, anyone who speaks the command word
"alhora" while holding the crystal experiences everything you
experienced. Once the memory has been experienced three times, the
memory vanishes from the crystal. Only one memory may be stored at a
time in a given crystal.
