# Spells

This chapter lists all of the spells available to characters.

## Demonic, Level One

### Beetle Boils

*Range:* 25'

*Duration:* 2 rounds

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You hurl a bag of dried beetle wings and cow's blood at the
victim. Their body is immediately covered, head to toe, in
painful boils. At the end of the spell, the boils burst and
small beetles erupt forth from them. The burst causes 1d4
damage and horrifies the victim. The beetles will fly away
from the victim. These beetles have the essence of their
victim within them, and may be used as components for spells
that require such.

### Ferocious Corruption

*Range:* Infinite

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 3

You create an effigy of a specific living thing. The effigy must
be made with some part of the thing in question, whether a hair
or blood or other piece. As soon as you submerge the effigy in
a concoction of wine and blood, the victim becomes angrier
and more aggressive, even towards friends.

### Withering Touch

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You touch a living thing and drain its life essence, causing 1d8
damage and making the target visibly weaker and shrivelled. In
humanoids, this can take the form of an almost skeletal appearance,
with sunken eyes and skin stretched thinly over the bones. The
appearance effect lasts until the victim gets a good night's sleep.

## Divine, Level One

### Censure

*Range:* 25'

*Duration:* 1 round

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You cry out a brief declaration at the victim, and they are
immediately brought to their knees. They are forced to remain
that way for the duration of the spell.

### Consecrate Ground

*Range:* Special

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 3

By tracing the intended area of effect with your footsteps while
chanting a prayer to your patron deity, you consecrate the area
in their name. For the duration of the spell, any creatures opposed
to the will of your patron deity find it difficult to enter the
affected area. Entering the area causes them physical pain,
though it does no damage. You may trace an area of any size or
shape, as long as you are able to complete the tracing of the area
within a single recitation of your prayer. The area extends up to
ten feet above and below the area traced.

### Ease Pain

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You lay a hand on a creature or person and they immediately feel
better, both physically and mentally. They regain 1d4+1 lost Hit
Points and any suffering they are undergoing is reduced in
severity.

## Elemental, Level One

### Dampen

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

The object or living thing that you touch becomes covered in a fine
mist of water. It's not enough to douse a flame, but it may deter
a flame from starting.

### Fresh Air

*Range:* 50'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You clap your hands together and all of the air in range of the spell
is immediately clean and clear. If there's a vacuum, it is filled
with clean air. Anyone in range of the spell that is asphyxiating
can immediately breathe again, if only for a moment.

### Kindle Flame

*Range:* 5'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

A nonliving, flammable object within range suddenly lights on fire.
The initial flame is no bigger than the palm of a hand, but it can
spread quickly.

### Minor Quake

*Range:* 20'

*Duration:* 1 round

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

For the duration of the spell, a 3' radius circle of earth within
range shakes and rumbles. Any creatures standing on the affected
area are thrown off balance. Any actions they attempt that require
a dice roll have a -1 penalty.

## Elemental, Level Two

### Find Water

*Range:* 1 mile

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

Any sources of water within range become known to the
caster. Whether they are salt water or fresh, drinkable
or not, also becomes known. For the duration of the
spell, the caster is aware of exactly how far away and
in what direction each source of water is.

## Enchantment, Level One

### Charm Small Animals

*Range:* 10'

*Duration:* 1 hour

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

All non-magical animals in range of the spell that are smaller than
a dog are immediately friendly towards you. They enjoy your company
and will protect you from threats as long as their own safety is
not threatened.

### Levity

*Range:* 30'

*Duration:* 5 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

A creature in range is suddenly possessed of great joy and happiness.
It is far less likely to be hostile, and far more likely to be
friendly. The effect is cancelled if the creature is attacked or
otherwise harmed.

### Lighten

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 24 hours

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

For the duration of the spell, the object or living thing that you touch
weighs half as much as it normally does.

### Obscure Object

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

An object smaller than a housecat becomes difficult to
see for the duration of the spell. It doesn't become
invisible; rather, anyone looking in its direction finds
their attention shifts away from it and they can't quite
make out what it is. Only the caster is able to see the
object normally.

## Gate Magic, Level One

### Blink Object

*Range:* 10'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

A nonliving object smaller than a door is instantly teleported
up to five feet away from its original position. It must teleport
to an empty space, and it doesn't necessarily teleport exactly
to the point specified.

### Message

*Range:* 10 miles

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You write a letter in magical characters on a simple piece of
paper. After you chant a few brief words and touch the letter,
it immediately vanishes. The recipient of the letter sees the
words of the letter appear in the air before them in a language
they can read. As soon as they finish reading the letter, or
if ten minutes pass, the words vanish.

### Second Step

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

For the duration of the spell, the creature that you touch walks
or runs twice as fast as normal. This does not affect combat
actions. The affected creature is hungry immediately after the
spell ends.

## Nature, Level One

### Find Healing Plants

*Range:* 1 mile

*Duration:* 1 hour

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You close your eyes and are immediately aware of any and all plants
in range of the spell that have healing properties. You know what
those properties are and how to use them for the duration of the
spell.

### Minor Growth

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You touch a patch of dirt. Shortly afterward, a plant of your choice
sprouts from the dirt, fully grown. The plant must be a nonsentient
variety.

### Vines

*Range:* 10'

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

Creeper vines burst from the ground and rapidly grow up the side of
a wall or building in range. The vines cover an area 10' x 10' in
size. After that, they cease their rapid growth and are, for all
intents and purposes, just normal vines.

## Necromancy, Level One

### Ghost Touch

*Range:* Touch

*Duration:* 1 hour

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You touch someone (or perhaps yourself) and chant a brief couplet.
That person is then able to touch ghosts as if they were material
creatures. This includes being able to hit them with nonmagical
weapons, but not anything that leaves their grasp (such as arrows).

### Haunted Visage

*Range:* Self

*Duration:* 30 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You utter a few gutteral words, and your appearance changes. You
appear as if recently risen from the dead, with gaunt features and
pale skin. The odor of freshly turned earth accompanies you.

### Speak to Spirits

*Range:* Earshot

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You send part of your consciousness into the spirit world.
While in this state, you can speak to any spirits within the immediate
vicinity. Taking damage in the material world will end the spell.

## Thought Magic, Level One

### Project Consciousness

*Range:* 100'

*Duration:* 10 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 2

You abandon your body, causing it to fall lifeless for the duration of
the spell. Your consciousness appears roughly in the area you specify,
though you have the same senses you would as if you were physically in
the area. Your consciousness is undetectable to normal senses. You
may end the spell early at will and return to your body. You are aware
of any harm that happens to your body, and if you are killed while in
this state, your consciousness immediately becomes an enraged ghost.

### Store Memory

*Range:* Self

*Duration:* 5 minutes

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You store the memory of everything that happens in your immediate
vicinity for the duration of the spell inside a crystal you are holding
as the spell ends. Afterwards, anyone who speaks the command word
"alhora" while holding the crystal experiences everything you
experienced. Once the memory has been experienced three times, the
memory vanishes from the crystal. Only one memory may be stored at a
time in a given crystal.

### Word of Warning

*Range:* 10 miles

*Duration:* Instantaneous

*Mana Point Cost:* 1

You visualize a person and make an arcane gesture with your hands.
You then send a single, brief sentence to them mind-to-mind. They
"hear" the sentence in their mind and can sense whatever emotion
you currently have.
