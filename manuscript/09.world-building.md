# World Building

This chapter is meant only for the Game Master. It offers
guidance on how to build a game world appropriate for Mysteries
of a Broken World.

## Building the Players' Freehold

The first world-building task for any *Mysteries* Game Master is
to create the freehold that the player characters call home. This
will be the players' home base, their main source of food and
information, and their cultural foundation.
