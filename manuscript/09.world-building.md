# World Building

This chapter is meant only for the Game Master. It offers
guidance on how to build a game world appropriate for Mysteries
of a Broken World.

## Using Hex Maps

Players are encouraged to use hex maps to record their explorations.
If you choose to go this route, then as the Game Master, you should
map out the initial area around the players' freehold to begin with.
