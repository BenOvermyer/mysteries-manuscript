\section{Alignment}

Your character's alignment reflects what primal force influences their life.
It may manifest subtly, such as in influencing your character's decisions.
It may also manifest dramatically, such as a monster with the same alignment
appearing in the area. Such major manifestations are rare, however.

Characters can only use magical items that share their own alignment, or have
no alignment.

\textbf{Equilibrium:} The primal force of Equilibrium seeks to limit all other
forces. Those who align with Equilibrium are just, merciful, or callous.

\textbf{Chaos:} The primal force of Chaos seeks continual renewal and change. Those
who align with Chaos are impulsive, brash, or mercurial.

\textbf{Destiny:} The primal force of Destiny seeks continuity and predictability.
Those who align with Destiny are imperious, fatalistic, or resilient.

\textbf{Void:} The primal force of Void seeks emptiness, clarity, and purity. Those
who align with Void are thoughtful, stern, or aloof.

\section{Afflictions}

Afflictions are random mutations caused either by mutant parentage or by
encountering a place of wild magic left over from the Breaking. Regardless
of whether the Affliction has a positive effect or not, all those who have
an Affliction are shunned by normal society. They are regarded as the
Afflicted.

Your character has a chance to have an Affliction at character creation. Roll
1d100. If the result is 3 or less, roll 1d100 on the following table.

\end{center}

\section{Spells}

If your character has a spellcasting class, then choose one spell from the
appropriate spell lists. This is the spell that your character knows at
the start of their journey.

\section{Mana Points}

If your character has a spellcasting class, then roll the Mana Die of your
class. If the result is a 1, you may reroll once. If your Intelligence
is higher than 12, add 1 to the result. This is your maximum Mana Points.

\section{Hit Points}

Look up the Hit Die of your class. Roll one of those dice. If the result is a
1 or a 2, you may reroll once. If your Constitution is higher than 12, add 1
to the result. This is your maximum Hit Points.

\section{Starting Money}

Your character begins the game with 3d6 x 10 silver coins. You can use this
money to buy starting equipment. See the Equipment chapter for a list of
things that you can buy. Adventurers typically are given this money by the
freehold they belong to, but the money may come from other sources.

\section{Character Details}

You may wish to write down a few extra details about your character, though
this is not required. Some things you may wish to think about are:

* Age
* Gender
* Weight
* Height
* Hair Color and Style
* Eye Color
* Skin Color
* Body Shape
* Family
* Hobbies
* Motivations
* Core Beliefs

\section{Advancement}

Your character will gain Experience Points for bringing treasure and knowledge
back from the wilds. Experience Points (or XP for short) are only gained once
your character returns what they've found to the rulership of their Freehold.

Once you have earned enough XP, you will gain a level. Once you do so, you roll
your class Hit Die and add the result to your maximum Hit Points. If your
Constitution score is higher than a 12, you add 1 to this total each time you
level up.

If you have a spellcasting class, the maximum level of spell that you can cast
increases by 1 each time you level up. So, if you are level 3, you can cast up
to (and including) level 3 spells. Also, roll your class Mana Die and add the
result to your maximum Mana Points. If your Intelligence score is higher than a
12, you add 1 to this total each time you level up.

Levels are gained every 1,000 XP.

\section{Learning Spells}

New spells are only gained by learning them from artifacts found in the ruins
of the old world. Most often, these will be spell scrolls or books. Another
spellcaster who knows the spell you seek to learn may be able to teach it to
you, but you must meet the level and spell list restrictions in order to
learn it.

Learning a new spell takes a number of weeks equal to the spell's level. The
caster must spend that time studying and practicing.
