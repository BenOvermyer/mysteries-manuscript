Table: Possible Character Afflictions

## Spells

If your character has a spellcasting class, then choose two spells from the
appropriate spell lists. These are the spells that your character knows at
the start of their journey.

New spells are only gained by learning them from artifacts found in the ruins
of the old world. Most often, these will be spell scrolls or books.

## Hit Points

Look up the Hit Die of your class. Roll one of those dice. If the result is a
1 or a 2, you may reroll once. If your Constitution is higher than 12, add 1
to the result. This is your maximum Hit Points.

## Starting Money

Your character begins the game with 3d6 x 10 gold coins. You can use this
money to buy starting equipment. See the Equipment chapter for a list of
things that you can buy.

## Character Details

You may wish to write down a few extra details about your character, though
this is not required. Some things you may wish to think about are:

* Age
* Gender
* Weight
* Height
* Hair Color and Style
* Eye Color
* Skin Color
* Body Shape
* Family
* Hobbies
* Motivations
* Core Beliefs

## Advancement

Your character will gain Experience Points for breaking treasure and knowledge
back from the wilds. Experience Points (or XP for short) are only gained once
your character returns what they've found to the rulership of their Freehold.

Once you have earned enough XP, you will gain a level. Once you do so, you roll
your class Hit Die and add the result to your maximum Hit Points. If your
Constitution score is higher than a 12, you add 1 to this total each time you
level up.

If you have a spellcasting class, the maximum level of spell that you can cast
increases by 1 each time you level up. So, if you are level 3, you can cast up
to (and including) level 3 spells.

Levels are gained every 1,000 XP.
