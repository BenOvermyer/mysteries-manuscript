This chapter lists monsters and other creatures that the

Goblins are small, foul-smelling creatures with reedy limbs,
pointed ears, and crooked noses. Their yellow eyes look greedily
upon everything they see. The driving force behind a goblin's
decisions is hunger first and greed second. They are cowardly
creatures.

## Hobgoblin

**Armor Class:** 15

**Hit Dice:** 1

**Move:** 30'

**Attacks:** Spear, trident, or throwing axe

**No. Appearing:** 1-4 (1d4)

**Intelligence:** 10

**Alignment:** Chaos

Hobgoblins are larger, more intelligent, and more vicious
cousins to goblins. They have yellow or sand-colored skin,
bright red eyes, and stand around six feet tall. Where
goblins are cowardly, hobgoblins are devious. While they
won't shy from a fight, they prefer to lay traps and set
ambushes.

## Orc

**Armor Class:** 14

**Hit Dice:** 1

**Move:** 30'

**Attacks:** Short sword, hand axe, or short bow

**No. Appearing:** 1-4 (1d4)

**Treasure Type:** Meager

**Intelligence:** 8

**Alignment:** Chaos

Orcs are brutish creatures with pointy ears and green skin. They
have short tusks protruding from their lower jaw and a slanted
brow. Large and violent, orcs are prone to raiding and pillaging.
They have thrived in the chaos that followed the Breaking. Some
say there are orcish cities in the wilderness where bloodshed is
the only law.

## Orthrus

**Armor Class:** 14

**Hit Dice:** 3

**Move:** 60'

An orthrus is a two-headed hound commonly found living with
giants. It stands six feet at the shoulder and comes in a
variety of mud colors. Orthruses are loyal companions and
more intelligent than most beasts, though their two heads
sometimes compete with each other over affections.
