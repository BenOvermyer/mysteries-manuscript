upon everything they see. The driving force behind a goblin's

An orthrus is a two-headed hound commonly found living with
giants. It stands six feet at the shoulder and comes in a
variety of mud colors. Orthruses are loyal companions and
more intelligent than most beasts, though their two heads
sometimes compete with each other over affections.
